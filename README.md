It's a small tool to download past broadcasts from Twitch.tv. You can enter a URL to a past broadcast.

## HowTo use it:
It's has a wizard like GUI. You enter a URL of a past broadcast first. Select the destination folder and file in the
second step. You are able to select how many parts of a broadcast should be downloaded at the same time. Twitch limits
each download to ~550KB/s. If u have an internet connection that is faster than that u can use more workers (2nd step)

A m3u-playlist is created to make watching the past broadcast easier.
